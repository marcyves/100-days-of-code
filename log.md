# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 

- Started the 100 Days of Code in order to track my progress with completing a long time project: ZOGG.
- I am using this App for many years to help me with grading students group work during a course. So it may be considerd 'production ready'. However, there are some mandatory features missing in order to be used by someone else.
    - Installation procedure.
    - Most administration features.

Thus I started working on the adminstration...

**Thoughts:**

- The DB model needs improvements, should I correct it and restart most coding ? Or should I just keep that for later because 'it just works' ?
- I don't like the user interface even if I made it. It needs improvements too but I will focus first on features.

### Day 2: April 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 

- Looked into GitHub features to track my progresses. Created a project, wiki, issues. I still need to move the todo into issues.
- Administration now allows to create schools, programs and courses. Update and delete will follow soon.

**Thoughts:**

- The user interface of the new admin page needs (lots of) improvements too but I will focus first on features.

### Day 3: April 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 

- Administration now allows to delete schools, programs and courses. Update postponed... 

**Thoughts:**

- I'd like to have a clean install in order to prepare a demo website.

### Day 4: April 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 

- Preparing for installation procedure
- Created install folder with SQL to create and initialize tables
- Basic process described in the Wiki
- Prepared demo website at http://zogg.xdm-consulting.fr 
- Identified a lot of bugs in fresh install, I need to identify and list them

**Thoughts:**

I am amazed how much progress I could make on this project in a few days!

### Day 5: May 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 

- Administration improvements, mainly for the presentation. 

**Thoughts:**

- The demo site is very helpful to test different situations. It's more a test site than a demo one, my only constraint is to check I did not break anything before I stop working on it.

### Day 6: May 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 

- Small Administration improvements, creation of the assignment menu. 

**Thoughts:**

- Busy day. Making many progresses on this project, however I need to go back to normal life
