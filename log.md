# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 

- Started the 100 Days of Code in order to track my progress with completing a long time project: ZOGG.
- I am using this App for many years to help me with grading students group work during a course. So it may be considerd 'production ready'. However, there are some mandatory features missing in order to be used by someone else.
    - Installation procedure.
    - Most administration features.

Thus I started working on the adminstration...

**Thoughts:**

- The DB model needs improvements, should I correct it and restart most coding ? Or should I just keep that for later because 'it just works' ?
- I don't like the user interface even if I made it. It needs improvements too but I will focus first on features.
